REST service example from scratch.

Basic CRUD operations.
Project developed in Netbeans with Glassfish server and the included (in glassfish Server) Derby DB.
The project responses are in xml and json, edit your request header acoordingly to receive either.

This is an educational example to help understand REST services.
Tests were done with SoapUI, but you can use any other software to send requests to the project once it is deployed on server.
SoapUI project included as test guide but it is strongly suggested to create one from the URL of your local server once MenuREST 
is deployed.
